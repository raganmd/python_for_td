Printing out lines isn't especially interesting on the face of it. That being said, this is one of the most powerful places to get your bearings. I almost always start any python related task by printing out bits of pieces of what I'm up to. It lets me see into the otherwise invisible process of code execution. Many folks will swear by this or that debugger, but at the end of the day your best debugging tool is just printing out what's happening. Learning the ins and outs of printing will also transfer to a number of different bits and pieces along the way. We'll start here as a way to get a solid handle on a few basic elements.
