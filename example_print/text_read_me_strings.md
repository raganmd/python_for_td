## Printing Strings ##

A string is a series of characters that won't be evaluated as numbers. 

Why does that matter? Well, while we've often internalized a difference between different kinds of characters, we need a way of specifying that difference to a machine. We often can't assume that the machine intrinsically knows what a series of characters might be. Most of the time we might think of strings as words. That's not always the case, but as a rule of thumb we might think of them as "words."

These examples look at various ways we might print strings, multiple lines of strings, how we can print strings stored as variables, and even substitute in words in strings when we print.
